"Nagas repeatedly disrupted peace in the world of the Drakes, and the gravest "

"He divided his large Naga army into three groups that were to attack the "
"island from three different directions. Orofarnië’s foresight, and "
"suggestions, helped the Drakes to identify the weaker of the three attacking "
"forces. The Drakes then focused on the weakest force, and soon defeated "
"them. Immediately, a small, fast squad of Drakes pushed through the opening, "
"reached Zpsekk, and assassinated him. This shrewd strategy caused the Naga "
